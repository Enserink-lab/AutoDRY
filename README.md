## AutoDRY 

AutoDRY (<ul>Auto</ul>phagy <ul>D</ul>ynamics <ul>R</ul>pository <ul>Y</ul>east) 
is a web portal that provides access to data from a study on genome-wide autophagy 
dynamics in yeast.

### What is AutoDRY?

The autophagy profiles of individual genes or groups of genes can be
explored in the context of genome-wide patterns. Both nutrient response
kinetics and Bayesian analysis of autophagic stages are available,
providing insights into each geneâ€™s activation timing and specific roles
in autophagosome formation and clearance.
