<ol><li> <b>Nutrient Response Kinetics</b>: By tracking the percentage of cells with active autophagy, the response to changes in nutrient availability was quantified for each mutant strain. The kinetics of autophagy activation and deactivation was quantified using a double-sigmoidal curve fitting approach. This analysis revealed the sensitivity and timing of each gene’s response, showing how quickly autophagy ramps up during nutrient starvation and subsides when nutrients are replenished.</li><li> <b>Latent Space Analysis of Autophagic Stages</b>: In addition to response kinetics, Bayesian analysis was applied to the neural network’s latent space features to identify distinct autophagic profiles across mutants. This approach highlights genes with specific disruptions in either the formation or clearance of autophagosomes, providing a window into the multi-stage regulation of autophagy. By pinpointing which genes impact these distinct stages, deeper insight is gained into how autophagy is finely controlled at each step of the process.</li></ol>
