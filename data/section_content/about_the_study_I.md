A yeast library of nearly 6,000 gene deletions was created in which each mutant expresses the fluorescent markers mNeonGreen-Atg8 and Pep4-mCherry to visualize autophagy. These yeast strains were starved for nitrogen for 12 hours, followed by nitrogen replenishment for another 7 hours. Cellular responses were imaged every hour, thus creating a time-resolved, high-content dataset. Deep learning methods were used to predict which cells are actively undergoing autophagy, allowing for identification of subtle differences in autophagy activity. Autophagy dynamics was then mapped onto a “feature space” that captured each gene's unique impact on autophagy over time.
